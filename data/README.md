## Data Tiers

| Tier | Label | Source | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | SYNTHETIC-BENCHMARK | Constructed from public aggregates | Available |
| 2 | GASTAT-OFFICIAL | Official GASTAT IO/SUT tables | Awaiting access |
| 3 | NOWCAST | RAS-balanced update of Tier 2 | Future (engine ready) |

## Synthetic Model: saudi_io_synthetic_v1.json

**NOT official GASTAT data.** This is a synthetic 20-sector Saudi IO model
constructed from publicly available data for demonstration and methodology
validation. Replace with official GASTAT tables when available.

### Construction Method

Generated by `scripts/build_synthetic_model.py` using:
1. Total output vector (x) from Saudi GDP composition (World Bank, GASTAT summaries)
2. Target value-added ratios from national accounts structure
3. Inter-sector flow structure weights encoding ISIC linkage patterns
4. Column-normalized Z construction: Z[i,j] = x[j] * (1 - VA_ratio[j]) * W_norm[i,j]

### Sector Assumptions

| Sector | Name | Output (SAR M) | VA Ratio | Key Flow Assumptions | Source |
|--------|------|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| A | Agriculture | 55,000 | 0.52 | Sells to C (food processing), I (food service) | World Bank WDI 2022 |
| B | Mining/Oil | 950,000 | 0.72 | Low backward linkage (enclave); sells to C, D | KAPSARC IO analysis, GASTAT |
| C | Manufacturing | 420,000 | 0.28 | High intermediate inputs; buys from B, imports | GASTAT industry accounts |
| D | Electricity | 55,000 | 0.52 | Buys fuel from B; sells to all sectors | ECRA, SEC reports |
| E | Water/Waste | 28,000 | 0.48 | Moderate linkages; SWCC/NWC operations | GASTAT, NWC annual report |
| F | Construction | 280,000 | 0.38 | Broad supply chain: C (materials), B, G, H, M | KAPSARC multiplier study |
| G | Trade | 260,000 | 0.56 | Margin-based; intermediates goods to all sectors | GASTAT retail statistics |
| H | Transport | 170,000 | 0.44 | Buys fuel (B), vehicles (C); serves all sectors | GASTAT, Saudi logistics strategy |
| I | Accommodation | 65,000 | 0.48 | Buys from A (food), G (supplies); tourism growing | SCTA, GASTAT |
| J | ICT | 95,000 | 0.58 | Knowledge-intensive; sells to K, O, M | CITC sector reports |
| K | Financial | 175,000 | 0.66 | High VA; sells services to all business sectors | SAMA banking sector reports |
| L | Real Estate | 140,000 | 0.76 | Very high VA (rent); buys from F (maintenance) | GASTAT national accounts |
| M | Professional | 80,000 | 0.62 | Human capital intensive; sells to F, O, J | GASTAT services survey |
| N | Admin/Support | 55,000 | 0.50 | Facility management, security; serves all sectors | GASTAT |
| O | Public Admin | 320,000 | 0.72 | High VA (salaries); some procurement from all | GASTAT, Civil Service Bureau |
| P | Education | 130,000 | 0.68 | High VA (teacher salaries); limited intermediate | MoE statistics |
| Q | Health | 85,000 | 0.60 | Staff + medical supplies from C; pharma imports | MoH statistics |
| R | Arts/Recreation | 18,000 | 0.52 | Small sector; growing under Vision 2030 | GEA, GASTAT |
| S | Other Services | 25,000 | 0.55 | Mixed personal services | GASTAT |
| T | Households | 12,000 | 0.82 | Almost entirely labor (domestic workers) | ILO, GASTAT household survey |

### Multiplier Calibration Notes

| Sector | Multiplier | Target Range | Source |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| F (Construction) | ~2.2 | 1.8-2.5 | KAPSARC published ~2.1 for Saudi Type I |
| B (Mining/Oil) | ~1.5 | 1.1-1.5 | Enclave-like, consistent with resource economies |
| C (Manufacturing) | ~2.4 | 1.6-2.5 | Intermediate-heavy, consistent with ESCWA regional |
| G-S (Services) | ~1.5-2.1 | 1.3-2.2 | Varies by type, consistent with ESCWA benchmarks |

### Important Distinctions

- **Total output (x)** is NOT GDP. GDP = sum(value_added). Ratio: output/GDP ~ 1.7
- **Value added** = total output minus intermediate consumption
- **Output multiplier** = column sum of Leontief inverse B = (I-A)^{-1}
- All values in SAR millions unless stated otherwise

## Provenance Policy

Every model file MUST include:
1. `source` field identifying the data origin
2. `provenance` section with method, sources list, and caveats
3. Clear labeling: SYNTHETIC, OFFICIAL, or NOWCAST
4. No fabricated "GASTAT" labels on synthetic data

## Rebuilding the Synthetic Model

```bash
python -m scripts.build_synthetic_model    # Regenerate from assumptions
python -m scripts.validate_model data/curated/saudi_io_synthetic_v1.json  # Validate
```
